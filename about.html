					<h1>About ComfyMoon</h1>
					<h2>ComfyMoon - Next Generation Hyper-Deflation</h2>
					<p>Transaction fees are: 2% if <= 0.001%, 4% if <= 0.0025, 6% if <= 0.005%, 8% if <= 0.01%, 12% if <= 0.025%, 16% if <= 0.05%, 20% if <= 0.1%, 24% if <= 0.5%, 30% if > 0.5%.<br>
					Half of the fee is added to the PancakeSwap Liquidity Pool to ensure a steadily rising floor price and stability<br>
					Half of the fee is distributed to ComfyToken holders automatically<br>
					Since 50% of the supply was burned in the beginning, 50% of that fee will be burned as well. Burn rate will increase in time, creating deflation pressure!<br>
					50% of the fee to holders</p>

					<h2>ComfyMoon - Next Gen</h2>
					<p>ComfyMoon is a proud Comfy fork that corrects some of the issues of the original contract such as making the token truly deflationary by increasing the size of the black hole as well as renouncing full ownership of the contract, ensuring that you can truly be comfy!<br> ComfyMoon had a Fair and Stealth launch on DxSale, with a renounced contract; Nothing can stop ComfyMoon!<br>
					One of the major features that tokens such as Comfy lack is a deflationary black hole.  ComfyMoon corrects this issue by creating a HYPER deflationary black hole with over 66% of the supply being burned, ensuring a constantly increasing price floor.</p>
